## Library Management System

The Library Management System is a Python application built using PyQt5 that allows users to efficiently manage a library's collection of books. The system provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to perform various tasks such as adding new books, updating book information, and managing borrower records.

### Features

- **Book Management**: Librarians can easily add new books to the system by entering details such as title, author, genre, and publication date. They can also update existing book information and remove books from the collection.

- **Borrower Management**: The system allows librarians to keep track of borrowers and their borrowing history. They can add new borrowers, update their information, and view the books borrowed by each borrower.

- **Search and Filtering**: Librarians can search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, or genre. They can also apply filters to narrow down the search results and find specific books quickly.

- **Excel Integration**: The system stores all the data in an Excel file, making it easy to manage and analyze the library's collection. Librarians can export the data to Excel for further analysis or import data from an existing Excel file.
